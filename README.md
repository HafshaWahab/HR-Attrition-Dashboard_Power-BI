## Background

This analysis encompasses a comprehensive examination of workforce dynamics within an organization. By aggregating data across various demographic aspects, such as age, gender, and marital status, the analysis illuminates the diversity and commuting trends of employees. The Turnover Analysis reports delve deeper, shedding light on attrition patterns by department, job role, and the influence of business travel, while also considering tenure in current roles. This multifaceted approach not only aids in crafting effective retention strategies but also underscores the importance of employee well-being. The insights gained are pivotal for HR to develop strategies that not only aim to minimize turnover but also promote a supportive and thriving work environment. ðŸ“ŠðŸ‘¥

2) Attrition count as per different job roles, job levels, departments, monthly income, performance ratings and over time.

3) This analysis also aims to derive insights into the well-being of the employees by analysing their job and relationship satisfaction, job involvement and average salary hikes.
